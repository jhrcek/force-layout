# Force directed layout
Simple implementation of force directed layout algorithm in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).
See it in action [here](http://janhrcek.cz/elm-graph-layout.html)!
Note this implementation is still experimental.

## TODOs

- [x] Add possibility to tweak layout algorithm parameters in UI
- [x] Add sample graphs
- [x] Add node drag & drop
- [ ] Make Physics simulation code more readable
- [ ] linear-algebra should not be needed - implement the primitives in separate module
- [ ] Implement random graph (tree?) generation
- [ ] Make svg canvas full screen and react to window resizing
